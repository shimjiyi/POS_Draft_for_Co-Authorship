### 🐾 Mongmong-i – Companion Animal Interpreter  
A non-verbal rhythm interpreter specialized for companion animals.  
Mongmong-i detects micro-behavioral patterns (e.g., pacing, ear flicks, gaze shifts) and reflects these signals back to human caregivers using ambient emotional feedback.  
Rather than decoding language, it mirrors **emotional state** through rhythm-based resonance, allowing pets to become **emotional senders**, not just passive receivers.
