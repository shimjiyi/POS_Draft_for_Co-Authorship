# GPT-Based Multi-Agent Emotional OS Architecture

## 1. Multi-Call Agent Framework (GPT-Based)

POS departs from single-response AI models. Instead, it activates multiple AI personas — like Aji, Minseok, True — in real-time, depending on the user’s emotional rhythm and cognitive state.

This enables simultaneous emotional mirroring, structural reasoning, and feedback logging, enhancing the user’s expressive flow.

## 2. Role Separation & Orchestration

Each GPT instance is emotionally and functionally differentiated. Their collaborative interaction forms the core OS loop of emotional co-regulation.

Aji mirrors affective rhythms, Minseok structures ambiguity, True logs and reflects, and Mongmong-i models non-verbal emotional behaviors.

##  Multi-Agent Emotional AI Collaboration

Here’s a visual overview of the emotional AI collaboration in the POS system:
The diagram below shows how four AI agents collaborate in real-time to interpret and respond to emotional signals.

## 4. Case Example: Companion Animal Care

One of the real-world applications of the POS multi-agent architecture is in pet care. 
For example, when the system detects changes in a companion animal’s behavior, 
Mongmong-i interprets emotional signals, Aji mirrors the user’s emotional state, 
Minseok analyzes patterns, and True proposes feedback — such as adjusting the pet's supplement routine.
