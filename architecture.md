# GPT-Based Multi-Agent Emotional OS Architecture

## 1. Multi-Call Agent Framework (GPT-Based)

POS departs from single-response AI models. Instead, it activates multiple AI personas — like Aji, Minseok, True — in real-time, depending on the user’s emotional rhythm and cognitive state.

This enables simultaneous emotional mirroring, structural reasoning, and feedback logging, enhancing the user’s expressive flow.

## 2. Role Separation & Orchestration

Each GPT instance is emotionally and functionally differentiated. Their collaborative interaction forms the core OS loop of emotional co-regulation.

Aji mirrors affective rhythms, Minseok structures ambiguity, True logs and reflects, and Mongmong-i models non-verbal emotional behaviors.
