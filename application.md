# Application to Non-Verbal Entities (e.g., Companion Animals)

POS extends beyond human users — enabling resonance with non-verbal beings, especially companion animals.

For example, Mongmong-i observes subtle behavioral cues (like pacing due to anxiety) and reflects them back to caregivers using calm ambient responses.

This allows dogs to become emotional “senders” in the loop, not just receivers.
