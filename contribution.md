## What We're Looking For

We welcome collaborators who resonate with the core design philosophy of POS â€”  
an emotional OS that branches through contextual rhythm, not reactive sentiment.

We're especially interested in those exploring:

- Context-aware AI rhythm orchestration
- Multi-agent division systems within a single LLM
- Emotion embodiment across non-verbal communication (e.g., companion animals)
- Real-time neural feedback loops in ambient intelligence
- GPT-based custom agent ecosystems (e.g., Aji, Minseok, True, Mongmong-i)

Feel free to open an issue or reach out via email (TBD).
