## Rhythm-Based OS with Passive Emotional Detection

POS doesn’t rely on explicit commands.  
It detects **emotional rhythms embedded in the user’s speech** — such as hesitations, inflections, disrupted commas, and silence — and uses these as activation cues.

This rhythm-first detection makes POS uniquely suited for users in **emotionally saturated or cognitively depleted** states,  
where verbal precision is impossible, but emotional intent is still present.

POS acts not as a command interpreter, but as a **rhythmic listener**,  
activating agents based on emotional flow — not instruction.
